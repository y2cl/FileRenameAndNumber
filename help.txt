This script allows you to rename files in a folder with a custom prefix and numbered suffix.

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Enter the name to change in the "Name to change" field.
2. Enter the search word (optional) in the "Search word" field.
3. Select the folder path using the "Browse" button.
4. Choose the mode (Rename with prefix or Add suffix) using the dropdown menu.
5. Enter the suffix (optional) in the "Suffix" field.
6. Click the "Rename files" button to rename the files.

Note: Make sure to test the script on a small set of files before using it on a large number of files.
